# React-Music-Application

This is a Simple React Music Desktop Player. Modeled off what a Desktop Music Application might look like. 

Deployed Heroku Link: https://morning-brushlands-68335.herokuapp.com/


Programming Tools => 
    This React Application was built STRICTLY with React Native. Using an npx-create-react command line. The entire font-end is built with React. Using React logic such as Hooks (useEffect, useState, useContext), Reducer, and Redux. Combining these with JSX properties within each component. It was a strong test to learn more about Javascript, React.js, JSX, and Reducers. 
    Due to this being a strictly FRONT-END React Application, there is no database. The back-end is comprised of a simple server.js with a controller folder to assist with deploying to Heroku and locally. 


Description =>
    Built with only React, this application is a model of what a more complex React-built Music Application would look like. Having the ability to create Playlists, save songs into Favorites, and remove songs from Favorites. Built with pre-selected songs. This is a true 'shell' of a friendly UI and sleak MusicPlayer Desktop Application. 

Installation =>
    No Installation is required, simply used the Deployed Heroku Link above.

Future Deployment (Coming Soon) => 
    The Ability to Play music through a built in library or a free music API. This is the next steps for the Application to be able to play, pause, and next tracks. 
    The Ability to find music and send them to their various Music end-users. Similar to how Shazam will find a track and offer to locate it in Spotify, Apple Music, etc. 
    The Ability to find out the way to learn the tracks you search. Such as if its a classical song with piano, you can get a link to how to play it.
